        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Gaming</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Mostly strategy games and cRPG's. Also, I'm a former licenced competitive chess player with
                    various medals, plaques, and cups.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Programming</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I've recently took up programming as a hobby. I started with VBA to automate repetitive
                    tasks in Excel.
                </li>
                <li>The company I worked for uses iOS, so some features of VBA are incompatible. I created very
                    simple Applescript apps when I couldn't use VBA. Since Applescript apps are easier to use for
                    end-users, I converted some code to Applescript code.
                </li>
                <li>After a while, I decided to take a formal course on Udemy. My preferred language is Python,
                    since it's syntactically simple to learn, so I could focus on core concepts of programming.
                    I've built many test applications including a password manager, an app that interacts with
                    Google Sheets using Pandas and Google Sheets API, a flash card program that gives a list of
                    words in English, and
                    changes them to your preferred language, while making a list of those you have learned, or yet to
                    learn.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Music</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I play the keyboard, and used to compose my own instrumental songs. <a
